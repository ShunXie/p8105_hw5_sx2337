# Problem 1

```{r,show_col_types = FALSE}

All_files_names = list.files("data/")

All_files = 
  tibble(
    Name = str_remove(All_files_names, ".csv")) %>% 
  separate(Name, into = c("Control_Experiment","Index"), sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(results =purrr::map(.x = str_c("data/",All_files_names), ~read_csv(.x, show_col_types = FALSE))) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("week_"),
    names_to = "week_number",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week_number, y=value, group = Index))+
  geom_line(aes(color = Index)) + facet_grid(. ~ Control_Experiment)+
  labs(title = "control and experiment value over week" )
All_files
```
Over the time, experiment group has a persistent increase over the week while the control group has value relatively stable values below 5.0. 



# Problem 2
```{r}
homocide_data = read_csv("data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
  replace(is.na(.),0)
homocide_data
```

The data contains ```r length(homocide_data)``` number of columns corresponding to different variables:

uid is a variable that uniquely identify the homocide case. Reported date gives the data that the homocide case is reported. Victim information such as the person's last name, first name, race, age and sex are also included in the variables. City and State variable corresponds to the city and state that the homocide happens, as well as the exact location measured in latitude and longitude in lat and lon variables in the dataset. The disposition variable shows the current state of the case. There are ```r length(unique(homocide_data$disposition))``` unique status of disposition, namely ```r unique(homocide_data$disposition)```. 


Combine the city_state. Then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides.
```{r}

homocide_data_new = 
  homocide_data %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) 

homocide_data_new%>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_obs = n(),
    n_unsolved = sum(disposition=='Closed without arrest')+sum(disposition=='Open/No arrest')
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```


For the city of Baltimore, MD, the proportion of homicides that is unsolved can be calculated here:
```{r}
homocide_data_new_Baltimore = filter(homocide_data_new, city_state == "Baltimore, MD")  

#save as an R object 
prop_Baltimore_result = prop.test(sum(homocide_data_new_Baltimore$disposition=='Closed without arrest' | homocide_data_new_Baltimore$disposition=='Open/No arrest'),length(homocide_data_new_Baltimore$disposition))

#save the data
save(prop_Baltimore_result, file = "results/Prop_result_Baltimore.RData")


#apply tidy function and pull the estimate and confidence intervals
prop_Baltimore_result %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

For all cities, first get all the distinct cities vector, and create a function that do the exact the same thing with city Baltimore:
```{r}
all_distinct_city = unique(homocide_data_new$city_state)


#define function
prop_test_function = function(cityname){
  dataset = filter(homocide_data_new, city_state == cityname)
  
  result = 
    prop.test(sum(dataset$disposition=='Closed without arrest' | dataset$disposition=='Open/No arrest'), length(dataset$disposition)) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

  #return result
  result
}
```


Now can iterate over all distinct cities using apply function and store in a list:
```{r}
prop_test_output = 
  expand_grid(city_name = all_distinct_city) %>% 
  mutate(test_df = map(all_distinct_city, prop_test_function)) %>% 
  unnest(test_df) %>% 
  arrange(desc(estimate))
prop_test_output
```


```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
ggplot(prop_test_output, aes(x=fct_reorder(city_name, estimate), y=estimate))+
  geom_point()+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=conf.low, ymax=conf.high))+
  labs(title = "Proportion of unsolved homocide among cities", )+xlab("City")
```
 The estimates are as indicated above. Tulsa, AL is the region that have only one case and the case is solved. Therefore, the confidence interval is large. 
 
 
# Problem 3

Define a function so that the input can take the value for sample size, population mean and population variance. Operate t test on the simulated sample to give a result to t test. 

```{r}
#Set the design elements in the default of function
sim_t_test = function(n=30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  sim_data = tibble(x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma))
  
  sim_data %>% 
    t.test(mu=0, alpha =.05) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    select(estimate, p.value)
}
sim_t_test()
```

Now generate 5000 times and save mu and pvalue:

```{r}
sim_results_mu0 = 
  expand_grid(
    mu_val = 0,
    iter = 1:5000
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    estimate_df = map(.x = mu_val, ~sim_t_test(mu=.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_df)
```





Based on the function, we can repeat over $\mu=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ using apply function:

```{r}
sim_results_over_mu = 
  expand_grid(
    mu_val=0:6,
    iter = 1:5000
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    estimate_df = map(.x = mu_val, ~sim_t_test(mu=.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_df)
```

Now make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected for each mu:

```{r}
sim_results_over_mu %>% 
  group_by(mu_val) %>% 
  summarize(proportion = sum(p.value<0.05)/length(p.value)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=mu_val, y=proportion))+
  geom_point(shape=19,size = 3)+
  labs(title = "Proportion of times the null mean=0 was rejected for different true mean" )+
  xlab("True Mean")+
  ylab("Proportion of Rejection")
```


Our hypothesis states that the mean equal to 0. As indicated by the plot, when the true mean increases, the power of rejecting the null hypothesis increases because there is a greater proportion of simulated sample has a pvalue smaller than 0.05. Therefore, when the true mean is more away from the hypothesis mean which is 0, (so the effect size measuring the differences between group with $\mu =0$ and true mean is larger), the test has more power to reject the null hypothesis. With a simulation of 5000 times, the relative big simulated number makes the plotting more stable and therefore more reliable. 


Now, I make a plot showing the average estimate of mean $\hat\mu$ against the true value of $\mu$:
```{r}
#define all_estimate_df to represent the average estimate value for all simulated values
all_estimate_df = sim_results_over_mu %>% 
  group_by(mu_val) %>% 
  summarize(avg_mu_hat = mean(estimate)) %>% 
  ungroup()

#define rejected_estimate_df to represent the average estimate value only in samples for which the null was rejected 
rejected_estimate_df = sim_results_over_mu %>% 
  filter(p.value<0.05) %>% 
  group_by(mu_val) %>% 
  summarize(avg_mu_hat = mean(estimate)) %>% 
  ungroup()


ggplot(all_estimate_df, aes(x=mu_val, y=avg_mu_hat))+
  geom_line(aes(color = "a"))+
  geom_line(data = rejected_estimate_df,aes(color = "b"))+
  scale_color_manual(name = ' ', 
                     values =c("a"='black',"b"='red'), 
                     labels = c('all values','rejected null values'))+
  geom_point(shape=19,size = 3)+
  geom_point(data = rejected_estimate_df,color = "red", shape=19,size = 3)+
  labs(title = "Average estimate of mean against the true value of mean" )+
  xlab("True Mean")+
  ylab("Average Estimated Mean")
```


In accordance to the plot, it seems like the sample average of $\hat \mu$ across tests for which the null is rejected is not approximately equal to the true value of $\mu$. When the true mean is between 0 and 4, the estimated values are very different from each other. This is because for all rejected null values, there estimated value are significantly different from the null hypothesis $\mu =0$. Thus, their estimated mean will likely to be greater than the overall estimated mean which includes estimated mean that is close to null hypothesis $\mu = 0$. But when the power of the test gets stronger, the average estimated mean for simulation with null rejected is similar to the one for all simulations. Especially for the case when effect size is large, in which case almost all cases are rejected. And therefore, estimate values for simulations with null rejected are tend to the estimated values for all cases.
